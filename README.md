Why My Simple Delivery Time Report Is Effective

1. Clear Objective
The report answers a key business question:
“How long does it take for mail to be delivered after it's sent?”
It helps stakeholders monitor performance and optimize mailing strategies.

2. Effective Layout
The report is organized into three clean sections:
-Interactive Filters (Postage, Wave, State) – for drill-down analysis
-Data Table – showing delivery counts and cumulative metrics
-Bar Chart – visualizing delivery patterns over time

3. Strong Visual Communication
Color Gradient in Table: Helps viewers instantly see the progression of delivery (% Delivered), from red (low) to green (fully delivered).
Chart: Reinforces the data with a visual trend. Bar heights make it easy to interpret the peak and drop-off points.

4. Analytical Value
The report includes running totals and percent delivered, which help track cumulative delivery performance.
Useful for both operational decision-making and performance benchmarking.
